2. Treat prompt-injected changed hunk snippets as authoritative changed code.

3. Compare that delta against baseline threat/vulnerability summaries as hypotheses.

   - reachability
   - auth/authorization weaknesses

7. Avoid repetitive broad Grep. Use targeted reads/greps scoped to specific files or changed top-level paths.
