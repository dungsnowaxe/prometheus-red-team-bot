## Detailed Findings

### 1. API Key Stored in Plain Text Environment Variable [🔴 CRITICAL]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/README.md:34`  
**CWE:** CWE-798  
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical

**Description:**

The ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is read directly from environment variables without any encryption or secure storage mechanism. Environment variables are visible to all processes under the same user and can be exposed through process listings, memory dumps, or log files.

**Code Snippet:**

```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Recommendation:**

Use OS-level secret management (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service), encrypt API keys at rest, implement key rotation, and clear the environment variable after reading.

---

### 2. Unsafe JSON Deserialization Without Schema Validation [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:373`  
**CWE:** CWE-502  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

Agent-generated JSON files are loaded using json.load() without any schema validation or size limits. This allows malformed JSON with deeply nested objects, extremely large numbers, or malicious content to cause resource exhaustion or crashes.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
results_data = json.load(f)
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement JSON schema validation before parsing, use safe JSON parsing with size and depth limits, validate all agent outputs against strict schemas, and sanitize file contents before processing.

---

### 3. Lack of Audit Logging for Security Operations [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:199`  
**CWE:** CWE-778  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

The scanner does not maintain persistent audit logs of scan operations, API calls, or security findings. There is no way to prove what was scanned, when, by whom, or what data was sent to the API, enabling repudiation attacks.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
class Scanner:
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement comprehensive audit logging with timestamps, user identification, repository hashes, API call details, and use centralized logging with integrity protection.

---

### 4. Unrestricted Source Code Transmission to Third-Party API [🔴 CRITICAL]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:298`  
**CWE:** CWE-200  
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical

**Description:**

All repository contents are sent to Anthropic's Claude API without filtering or user consent. The scanner uses permission_mode='bypassPermissions' allowing unrestricted file access, potentially exposing credentials, trade secrets, and proprietary code.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
permission_mode='bypassPermissions',
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement file filtering with .promptheusignore, redact sensitive patterns before API transmission, add explicit user consent prompts, use restrictive permission modes, and support local-only scanning options.

---

### 5. Unbounded API Cost Escalation via Environment Variable [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/config.py:92`  
**CWE:** CWE-770  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

The PROMPTHEUS_MAX_TURNS environment variable accepts any integer value without upper bound validation. An attacker can set arbitrarily high values like 999999 to cause excessive API calls costing hundreds of dollars.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
return int(os.getenv("PROMPTHEUS_MAX_TURNS", cls.DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS))
```

**Recommendation:**

Validate max_turns within reasonable bounds (10-200), implement hard cost limits with automatic termination, add cost estimation before scan start, and provide real-time cost warnings.

---

### 6. Unrestricted File System Write Access [🔴 CRITICAL]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:298`  
**CWE:** CWE-269  
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical

**Description:**

Scanner operates with permission_mode='bypassPermissions' and agents can write to any location on the file system. No path validation prevents writing to sensitive locations like ~/.ssh/, /etc/, or other system directories.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
permission_mode='bypassPermissions',
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement strict path validation to restrict writes to .promptheus/ only, use Path.resolve() to detect traversal attempts, change to requirePermissions mode, and run scanner in sandboxed environment.

---

### 7. Missing Path Traversal Protection [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:250`  
**CWE:** CWE-22  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

File operations use Path.glob() and direct file paths without canonicalization or symlink detection. Malicious repositories with symbolic links could cause the scanner to read files outside the repository directory.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
files_scanned = len(list(repo.glob('**/*.py')))
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement symlink detection and skip them, use Path.resolve() with validation, restrict operations to realpath within repository bounds, and add symlink warnings.

---

### 8. No Integrity Protection for Scan Results [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:364`  
**CWE:** CWE-494  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

Scan results in .promptheus/ directory have no signatures or checksums. An attacker with file system access could modify JSON files to remove vulnerabilities or change severity ratings without detection.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
results_file = promptheus_dir / SCAN_RESULTS_FILE
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement digital signatures for scan results, use checksums with separate storage, add result verification commands, and consider blockchain for tamper evidence.

---

### 9. No File Size Limits for Read Operations [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:373`  
**CWE:** CWE-400  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

The scanner doesn't check file sizes before reading them into memory. Large files like database dumps or logs could cause out-of-memory errors and crash the scanner.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
with open(results_file) as f:
                    results_data = json.load(f)
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement file size checks before reading, set maximum file size limits, use streaming/chunked reading for large files, and automatically skip binary files.

---

### 10. Potential API Key Exposure in Error Messages [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/cli/main.py:159`  
**CWE:** CWE-209  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

Error handling does not sanitize sensitive data. API keys could be exposed in error messages that are printed to console and potentially logged in CI/CD systems.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
console.print(f"\n[bold red]❌ Error:[/bold red] {e}", style="red")
```

**Recommendation:**

Sanitize all error messages to remove sensitive data, implement custom error handlers that filter credentials, use structured logging with field redaction.

---

### 11. No Protection Against Infinite Agent Loops [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:297`  
**CWE:** CWE-835  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

With high max_turns values, agents could enter infinite loops repeatedly analyzing the same files without progress detection, consuming unlimited API tokens.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
max_turns=config.get_max_turns(),
```

**Recommendation:**

Implement progress detection to identify loops, add timeouts for each phase, track repeated tool calls, and set reasonable default limits.

---

### 12. Missing User Attribution for Scans [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `/Users/anshumanbhartiya/repos/promptheus/packages/core/promptheus/scanner/scanner.py:359`  
**CWE:** CWE-862  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

Scans don't record who initiated them or from what system. In shared environments, it's impossible to attribute scans to specific users, enabling unauthorized scanning without accountability.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def _load_scan_results(
```

**Recommendation:**

Record user identity in scan metadata, implement scan authentication, add digital signatures to results, and integrate with enterprise authentication.
