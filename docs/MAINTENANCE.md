# Codebase Maintenance & Pruning Guide

## 📊 Current State

**PROMPTHEUS Stats:**
- 📁 28 Python files
- 📝 ~4,374 lines of code
- 🧪 181 tests
- 🏗️ Well-structured (16 core modules)

---

## 🎯 Maintenance Strategy

### 1. **Automated Dead Code Detection**

#### A. Set Up Regular Scans

**Tool: `vulture` (Python dead code detector)**
```bash
# Install
pip install vulture

# Create config: vulture.ini
[vulture]
min_confidence = 60
paths = packages/core/promptheus
exclude = venv/,__pycache__/,dist/,build/

# Run regularly
vulture packages/core/promptheus --min-confidence 80
```

**Schedule:** Run monthly or before major releases

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Install vulture
- [ ] Create `.vulture.ini` configuration
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Review and prune findings quarterly

---

#### B. Manual Dead Code Checklist

Run this checklist quarterly:

```bash
# 1. Find unused imports
cd packages/core
python3 -m pyflakes promptheus/ | grep "imported but unused"

# 2. Find files without imports (potentially unused)
find promptheus -name "*.py" -type f ! -path "*/test*" -exec grep -L "from.*import\|import" {} \;

# 3. Find functions/methods never called
# Use vulture as above

# 4. Check for commented-out code
grep -r "^[ ]*#.*def \|^[ ]*#.*class " promptheus/ --include="*.py"
```

**Review Questions:**
- ✅ Is this imported anywhere?
- ✅ Is this tested?
- ✅ Is this exported in `__all__`?
- ✅ Is this documented?

---

### 2. **Test Coverage Monitoring**

#### A. Set Coverage Targets

```bash
# Install coverage tools
pip install pytest-cov coverage

# Run coverage report
pytest --cov=promptheus --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Target: Maintain 80%+ coverage
```

**Coverage Goals:**
- 🎯 **Overall:** 80%+
- 🎯 **Core modules:** 90%+ (scanner, config, agents)
- 🎯 **Utilities:** 70%+ (reporters, CLI)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Generate coverage report monthly
- [ ] Identify uncovered code
- [ ] Either add tests OR remove if unused
- [ ] Add coverage badge to README

---

#### B. Coverage-Driven Pruning

```python
# Find untested code
pytest --cov=promptheus --cov-report=term-missing | grep "0%"

# Questions for 0% coverage code:
# 1. Is it actually used? → If no, DELETE
# 2. Is it critical? → If yes, ADD TESTS
# 3. Is it experimental? → Move to separate branch
```

---

### 3. **Documentation Maintenance**

#### A. Keep Docs in Sync (CRITICAL)

**Workflow for Every Code Change:**

```bash
# Before committing ANY code change:
1. Update docstrings in changed files
2. Update README.md if public API changed
3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md if structure changed
4. Update tests to match new behavior
5. Remove docs for deleted features (like we did with --streaming)
```

**Automation:**
```bash
# Create pre-commit hook: .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Checking for common doc issues..."

# Check for references to deleted features
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "\.(py|md)$" | while read file; do
  # Add patterns for known deleted features
  if git diff --cached "$file" | grep -i "streaming\|assess\|threat-model\|review"; then
    echo "⚠️  Warning: Reference to potentially deleted feature in $file"
  fi
done
```

---

#### B. Documentation Audit Checklist (Quarterly)

```markdown
## Documentation Audit

### READMEs
- [ ] All commands in README actually exist
- [ ] All flags in README actually work
- [ ] Code examples run without errors
- [ ] Installation instructions are current

### Architecture Docs
- [ ] Class names match actual code
- [ ] File paths are correct
- [ ] Diagrams reflect current structure
- [ ] No references to deleted components

### API Documentation
- [ ] Docstrings present for all public functions
- [ ] Parameter types documented
- [ ] Return types documented
- [ ] Examples in docstrings work

### Tests
- [ ] Test docstrings explain what's being tested
- [ ] No tests for deleted features
```

---

### 4. **Dependency Management**

#### A. Regular Dependency Audits

```bash
# Monthly: Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Quarterly: Security audit
pip-audit  # or: pip install pip-audit

# Yearly: Major version updates
# Review and update pyproject.toml dependencies
```

**Dependency Pruning Questions:**
- ❓ Is this still used?
- ❓ Can we use a lighter alternative?
- ❓ Is this a dev dependency that should be in [dev]?

---

#### B. Monitor Bundle Size

```bash
# Check package size
cd packages/core
python3 -m build
ls -lh dist/

# Target: Keep wheel < 1MB
```

---

### 5. **Code Quality Standards**

#### A. Set Up Automated Linting

```bash
# Install tools
pip install ruff black mypy

# Add to pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py310"
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "W"]
ignore = ["E501"]  # Line too long

[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ["py310"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
```

**Run regularly:**
```bash
# Format
black packages/core/promptheus

# Lint
ruff check packages/core/promptheus

# Type check
mypy packages/core/promptheus
```

---

#### B. Code Review Checklist

For every PR/commit:

```markdown
## Code Review Checklist

---

### 6A. **Security Policy Review Gate**

Before merging any change to scanner runtime permissions/tooling, require explicit security sign-off.

Trigger conditions:
- Any change to `permission_mode` in scanner execution paths
- Any change to scanner `allowed_tools` surfaces
- Any change to hook deny logic for out-of-repo access or restricted write paths

Required checks before merge:
- [ ] Security maintainer reviewed and approved the policy change
- [ ] Policy-lock tests pass:
  - `pytest packages/core/tests/test_scanner.py -k "full_scan_uses_current_bypass_permission_and_tool_surface"`
  - `pytest packages/core/tests/test_pr_review.py -k "generate_pr_hypotheses_uses_no_tools_and_bypass_permissions or refine_pr_findings_uses_no_tools_and_bypass_permissions"`
  - `pytest packages/core/tests/test_hooks.py -k "dast_db_block_denial_payload_has_expected_fields or out_of_repo_read_denial_payload_has_expected_fields"`

---

### 7. **Automated CI/CD Checks**

Create `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`:

```yaml
name: Code Maintenance

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  dead-code-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - run: pip install vulture
      - run: vulture packages/core/promptheus --min-confidence 80

  coverage-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - run: pip install -e "packages/core[dev]"
      - run: pytest --cov=promptheus --cov-fail-under=80

  dependency-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - run: pip install pip-audit
      - run: pip-audit
```

---

### 8. **Pruning Decision Framework**

When deciding whether to keep or remove code:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Is this code USED?                  │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────┘
              │
      ┌───────┴───────┐
      │               │
     YES             NO
      │               │
      ▼               ▼
┌─────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│ Is it       │  │ DELETE IT    │
│ TESTED?     │  │ IMMEDIATELY  │
└─────┬───────┘  └──────────────┘
      │
  ┌───┴────┐
  │        │
 YES      NO
  │        │
  ▼        ▼
┌────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│KEEP│  │ ADD TESTS or │
└────┘  │ DELETE       │
        └──────────────┘
```

**Priority for Deletion:**
1. 🔴 **High Priority:** Unused + Untested + Undocumented
2. 🟡 **Medium Priority:** Unused + Tested (someone wrote tests but it's not used)
3. 🟢 **Low Priority:** Used + Untested (add tests instead of deleting)

### 9. **Specific to PROMPTHEUS**

#### A. Keep Scanner Clean
```bash
# scanner/ should only have:
# - scanner.py (core implementation)
# - __init__.py (exports)
# No more validators.py, no helper modules
```

#### B. Monitor Agent Definitions
```bash
# Regularly check:
# 1. Are all 4 agents being used?
# 2. Are prompts up to date?
# 3. Are tool lists minimal?
```

#### C. Reporter Consistency
```bash
# Ensure reporters stay consistent:
# 1. Same interface
# 2. Same output format
# 3. No duplicate code
```

#### D. Artifact Cleanup
```bash
# Monitor .promptheus/ artifacts:
# Core artifacts (always created):
# - SECURITY.md
# - THREAT_MODEL.json
# - VULNERABILITIES.json
# - scan_results.json
# - scan_state.json (commit tracking for pr-review/catchup)

# Optional artifacts (only when --target-url provided):
# - DAST_VALIDATION.json (created by DAST agent)
# - DAST_TEST_ACCOUNTS.json (test accounts for DAST validation)
# - DIFF_CONTEXT.json (created by pr-review)
# - PR_VULNERABILITIES.json (created by pr-review)
# - pr_review_report.md (default markdown report from pr-review)

# Cleanup old artifacts periodically:
rm -rf .promptheus/*.old
rm -rf .promptheus/*~

# Keep artifacts in .gitignore to avoid committing scan results
```

---

## 💡 Golden Rules

1. **Delete > Comment Out** - Never comment out code, delete it (git has history)
2. **Test or Delete** - Untested code is dead code waiting to break
3. **Document as You Go** - Don't batch documentation updates
4. **Automate Everything** - Manual checks get skipped
5. **Review Weekly** - Small frequent cleanups > big refactors

---
